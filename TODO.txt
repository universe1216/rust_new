- Fix v8_source_maps.ts so that we don't get random segfaults.

- Add wildcard support to testdata/*.out tests so that we can check
  the stack trace output in testdata/007_stack_trace.ts and
  testdata/013_async_throw.ts.

- Remove text-encoding.d.ts because TS2.8 includes the declarations.

- Add permissions that control which afero.Fs gets loaded. Should be read-only
  by default. Also permissions for network access.

- Add os.statSync and os.tempDir- both are needed for the writeFileSync test in
  tests.ts

- Top-level await.

- Add ability to open TCP sockets and listen for connections.

- Add ability to receive HTTP connections (using net/http to parse)
  should try to use the same Request/Response types as fetch().

- Publish deno_testing to npm as a standalone module.

- Use mksnapshot instead of go-bindata.

- Use as library to build custom runtimes.
